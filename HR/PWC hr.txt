PWC:
(PricewaterhouseCoopers)

1) Why PWC?
PwC is one of the Big Four professional services firms, known globally 
for its excellence in consulting, audit, and technology-driven solutions.
I’m particularly interested in PwC because it’s a place that blends 
technology with real business impact.
As someone who loves building user-focused interfaces and working 
on modern technologies like React and cloud, 
PwC’s focus on digital transformation aligns perfectly with my interests.
I also value PwC’s culture of continuous learning and teamwork, 
which I believe will help me grow both technically and professionally.

2) Why You Want to Join PwC?
I want to join PwC because it’s a company that perfectly 
combines technology, innovation, and real business impact.
I’m passionate about front-end development, and PwC provides the 
kind of large-scale, cloud-integrated, modern UI projects where 
I can apply my skills in React, SCSS, and Material UI to create meaningful user experiences.
I also appreciate that PwC encourages learning and working with new technologies, 
which means I can keep growing as a developer while contributing to a 
global brand known for excellence.
More than anything, I see PwC as a place where I can learn, contribute, 
and grow into a better version of myself — both technically and professionally.
