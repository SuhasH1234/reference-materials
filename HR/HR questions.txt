### 1. Tell me about yourself
good morning, thankyou for giving me this oppurtunity to introduce. 
my name is Suhas H, and i recently graduated with a b tech degree in CSE from Presidency University. 
I have overall cgpa of 8.94, 
I have done done my internship in Vectrostack as a Reactjs(Front end dev) developer, where i gained 
hands-on experience in building responsive web applications,API integration, code optimization, 
and team collaboration.  
and got an oppurtunity to work on the company main project. 
i have also done my projects realted to full stack development like Timetable managemnt system, 
smart communication platform for varanasi artisans which includes technologies like \
java, springboot, react, js and other frameworks and technologies.
I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and 
excited to contribute to innovative projects.

### 2. Why do you want to join Sony?
I want to join Sony because it’s a company that truly values innovation and technology. 
As a global leader in both software and electronics, Sony provides the perfect environment 
to apply my skills in software development and learn from industry experts.
I’m genuinely excited about this role because it combines the areas I’m passionate about 
and have been actively learning — especially through my projects using Java, Spring Boot, React, 
and other frameworks.
I also admire how Sony values creativity and technical excellence equally. 
I believe that being in such an innovative environment will help me grow both technically 
and professionally. That’s why I see Sony as the perfect place to start and build my career.

### 3. What are your strengths?
My biggest strengths are adaptability, problem-solving, and teamwork. 
I adapt to new technologies quickly and apply them effectively to deliver results. 
I’m also good at adjusting to changing project requirements without losing focus.
For example, while developing my Timetable Management System, I had to implement secure authentication, 
so I quickly learned JWT and Spring Security within a few days — and successfully built a secure login system. 
That experience taught me how fast learning and persistence can solve real challenges.
I also value collaboration and feedback, because I believe that’s how individuals and teams continuously 
improve together.

### 4. What is your biggest weakness?
I sometimes spend too much time perfecting a small part of a project because I care about details. 
But I’ve been improving by prioritizing tasks better and focusing on completing high-impact work first.

### 5. How do you handle challenges or pressure?
I try to stay calm and focus on understanding the problem first.
I usually break the issue into smaller parts and tackle them step by step.
During my React internship, I once faced a critical API integration bug close to the delivery deadline. 
Instead of panicking, I analyzed logs, and resolved it within a few hours. 
I believe staying composed and analytical under pressure always helps.

### 6. How do you handle feedback or criticism?
I see feedback as a growth opportunity. During my internship, I received feedback about improving 
component reusability in React. I took it positively, refactored my code, and the overall performance improved. 
Constructive feedback motivates me to refine my skills and deliver better results.

### 7. What are your short-term and long-term goals?
In the short term, my goal is to gain hands-on industry experience in various kinds of software development.
In the long term, I aspire to become a senior software engineer who can design scalable, intelligent systems 
and contribute to digital transformation initiatives like those at Sony.

### 8. What’s your biggest achievement so far?
Building the Timetable Management System completely from scratch is something I’m proud of. 
It involved backend APIs, authentication, and frontend integration. It was challenging initially, 
but it gave me confidence that I can handle end-to-end development independently.

### 9. Describe a time you worked in a team.
In my Smart Communication Platform project for artisans, I worked in a small team where 
I handled both frontend and backend integration while another teammate focused on certain changes in UI. 
We collaborated using Git and regularly reviewed each other’s code. 
That project taught me the importance of clear communication and version control when working in teams.

### 10. How do you prioritize your tasks?
I usually list tasks based on their urgency and impact. 
I start with the most critical deliverables and then move to enhancements or optimizations. 
Tools like simple to-do lists help me stay organized.

### 11. Why should we hire you?
You should hire me because I don’t just write code — i understand how technology can solve real world problems. 
I’m adaptable, eager to learn, take feedback seriously, and always aim to deliver results that make a real impact.
Moreover the preferred skills mentioned perfectly matches to my skills.
I’ve already worked on full-stack applications, integrated REST APIs, and managed databases, 
so I can quickly get up to speed and start contributing to Sony’s projects.
More importantly, I bring a strong sense of problem-solving and teamwork responsibility skills.
I’m confident I can grow with Sony’s team — contributing to meaningful projects 
while continuously improving myself.

### 12. How do you keep yourself updated with new technologies?
I regularly follow YouTube channels, LinkedIn learning posts, and online learning platforms. 
I also take part in virtual hackathons and simulations — for example, genai...

### 13. What are your salary expectations?
Based on my research and understanding of the industry standards for this role, 
I would expect a salary in the range of [provide a range]. 
However, I’m open to discussing this further, considering the overall compensation package 
and opportunities for growth within [company].
